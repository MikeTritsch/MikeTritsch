### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mike Tritsch (think of it like Treech) and I am a mutli-faceted musician and junior developer. I absolutely love learning new things, which is why I decided to start my journey into the world of code. I have a wide array (pun-intended) of experience across the music industry from journalism to performance. I've shared the stage with award-winning artists, worked in data-driven corners of the music business, and am now on a mission to combine my love of code with my love of music. I'm always open to collaborate, talk shop, and share music. Drop me a line, let's chat!
